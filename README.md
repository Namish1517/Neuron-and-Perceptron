# Neuron-and-Perceptron
Python implementations of a single adjustable neuron and a multi-neuron perceptron for binary classification. The neuron can simulate logic gates by tuning weights and bias. Perceptron project uses pass/fail prediction based on student marks to illustrate core neural network concepts and activation functions
